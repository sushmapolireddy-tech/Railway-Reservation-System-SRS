## 🚆 Railway Reservation System – SRS Documentation

This repository contains the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document for a **Railway Reservation System**, prepared as part of an academic assignment during undergraduate studies.

---

## 📄 About the Project
The Railway Reservation System is designed to manage:
- Train details and timings
- Seat availability
- Ticket booking and billing
- Ticket cancellation and refund

The SRS document defines the **functional and non-functional requirements**, user classes, system features, and operating environment for the proposed system.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To clearly define system requirements before implementation
- To identify user roles such as **Passenger** and **Administrator**
- To describe system behavior for booking, payment, and cancellation
- To ensure clarity and completeness of software requirements

---

## 👥 User Classes
### Passenger
- Login to the system
- View train details and timings
- Check seat availability
- Book and cancel tickets
- Make payments and receive refunds

### Administrator
- Update train details and schedules
- Manage seat availability
- Cancel reservations when required
- Maintain system data

---

## ⚙️ System Features
- User Login / Logout
